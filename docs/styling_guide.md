## Color Psychology & Usage

**Character**: Professional, trustworthy, reliable
**Usage**: Primary actions, brand elements, headers, navigation
**Emotional Impact**: Instills confidence and trust in service quality

### Blue Variations
- **Dark Blue (`#1e3f73`)**: Authority, stability - use for hover states and emphasis
- **Light Blue (`#4a7bc8`)**: Approachability, friendliness - use for accents and secondary elements

### Neutral Palette
- **Text Dark (`#333333`)**: Primary readability, professional communication
- **Text Gray (`#666666`)**: Supporting information, descriptions
- **Light Gray (`#999999`)**: Metadata, captions, subtle information
- **White (`#ffffff`)**: Cleanliness, space, clarity

### Background Strategy
- **Pure White**: Clean, professional areas requiring focus
- **Light Gray (`#f8f9fa`)**: Subtle section separation without harsh contrast
- **Section Gray (`#f5f7fa`)**: Alternating sections for visual rhythm

## Typography Hierarchy

### Heading Philosophy
Typography should establish clear information hierarchy while maintaining professional readability. Each heading level serves a specific purpose in guiding user attention and organizing content.

**H1 (2.5rem, 700 weight)**: Page-level brand statements, primary headlines
**H2 (2rem, 600 weight)**: Major section divisions, service categories
**H3 (1.5rem, 600 weight)**: Subsection headers, feature highlights
**H4 (1.25rem, 500 weight)**: Card titles, component headers
**H5 (1.125rem, 500 weight)**: Minor section breaks, list headers
**H6 (1rem, 500 weight)**: Inline emphasis, small component titles

### Text Treatment Principles
- **Letter Spacing**: 0.5px-1px for brand elements to enhance readability
- **Line Height**: 1.6 for body text (readability), 1.2 for headings (impact)
- **Text Transform**: Uppercase reserved for brand elements and primary actions only
- **Font Weight**: Strategic use of weight to create visual hierarchy without overwhelming

## Spacing Philosophy

### Visual Rhythm
Consistent spacing creates visual rhythm and improves content scanability. The spacing system is based on multiples of 4px for pixel-perfect alignment across all screen sizes.

**Micro Spacing (4px)**: Icon alignment, tight element grouping
**Small Spacing (8px)**: Related element margins, form field spacing
**Medium Spacing (16px)**: Standard paragraph spacing, button padding
**Large Spacing (24px)**: Component separation, section breathing room
**Extra Large (32px)**: Major component padding, generous interactive areas
**Maximum (48px)**: Section-level spacing, page breathing room

### Breathing Room Strategy
Generous white space communicates professionalism and prevents visual overwhelm. Use larger spacing for premium service perception and improved content comprehension.
